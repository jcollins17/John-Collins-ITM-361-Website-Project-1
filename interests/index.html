          <li><h3>Video Games</h3></li>
          <h4>I am an avid gamer.  I own many different games on PC.  If i had to pick one of those games to be my favorite, it would be a game called VVVVVV.</h4>
          <li><h3>Computers</h3></li>
          <h4>Being a PC gamer, I also have a variety of computers at my disposal.  My main PC is a custom built PC that I built and designed myself.  I also have 2 laptops, one of which I use for class and the other for portable gaming.  Lastly, over the summer, I have come to own 2 apple computers, one is an Imac from 2005 and the other is a Mac Mini from 2011.  The apple computers are being used as server machines.
          <li><h3>Programming</h3></li>
          <li><h3>Memes</h3></li>
