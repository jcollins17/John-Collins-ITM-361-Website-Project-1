      <h2>Here are some of my Interests</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><h3>Video Games</h3>
            I am an avid gamer.  I own many different games on PC.  I have many favorite games, here are a few of my favorites.

                  <img src="VVVVVV.jpeg" alt="VVVVVV"/>
                  <figcaption>VVVVVV is a challenging platforming game by Terry Cavanagh that has the very neat mechanic of your character not being able to jump.  However, you do have the ability to invert gravity if you are standing on a surface.  This is my favorite game at the moment.</figcaption>

            <h3>Computers</h3>
            Being a PC gamer, I also have a variety of computers at my disposal.  My main PC is a custom built PC that I built and designed myself.  I also have 2 laptops, one of which I use for class and the other for portable gaming.  Lastly, over the summer, I have come to own 2 apple computers, one is an Imac from 2005 and the other is a Mac Mini from 2011.  The apple computers are being used as server machines.
